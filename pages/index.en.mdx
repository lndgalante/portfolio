Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Leo, a Frontend Engineer, I enjoy creating programming educational content and I'm also creating my first product for developers and designers called [Which Icon is That?](https://www.whichiconisthat.com).

I'm an organizer at [ReactBA](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/React-en-Buenos-Aires) meetup where we have monthly talks about its ecosystem.
Recently I've created a small local community at my home town called CdelU Devs.

I deeply care about product development craft through the use of the latest technologies, simplicity, performance, functional-design, and a user-first approach. ðŸ’Ž

New videos at [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/leonardogalante) every Tuesday and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lndgalante) streamings every Wednesday.
