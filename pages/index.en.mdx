Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Frontend developer at TradeHelm and I enjoy creating educational content.
I'm also a organizer at [ReactBA](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/React-en-Buenos-Aires) meetup were we have monthly talks all-about React.

I want to help you improve your product development craft through the latest technologies, best practices, simple patterns, and a user-first approach ðŸ’Ž

New videos at [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/leonardogalante) every Tuesday and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lndgalante) streamings every Wednesday âœ¨
