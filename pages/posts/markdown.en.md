# Simplicity over Complexity

I like to update my website every 1-2 years just to bring a new perspective and a new look to it.
For the latest iteration I hired a designer to help me come with fresh ideas.
The design was really cool but I've never could get my wrap around since I really like minimalism over any other aspect and the design feeled to me kinda convoluted.
Minimalism brings me peace, armony and a sense of good organization and those are **values** that I want to _share_ to other people.

When [@leerob](https://twitter.com/leeerob) publish this starter made with Next.js and Nexta I fall in love immediately since not only was made with great technologies but also with a simple approach in design terms. So that's it even that I knew that could be widely used I'll probably end up with a similar design to this one.

Thanks Vercel ðŸ–¤
